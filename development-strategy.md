# Development Strategy

> Acme Web Design: Code Along

* In this project we will make a simple corporate website that is based on the example of Acme Web Design by Traversy Media. From the [wireframe](#wireframe) we can see the HMTL layout that will be covered in this project and respective style with CSS will be made accordingly.
* Here you can also see how the project is developed step by step (0-x) as per Agile values, through branches containing a user story. It means that we have to see the development of this company site based on the perspective of the web visitor, what do they want to know or seek in this company site? Then we applied it to the development our page. We can see what is needed to be done in each branch in order to answer to the user story and its needs.
* This project is a great exercise for those who want to get familiar with Agile values to develop a project. It will be useful (by making branches) when we need to try and make some changes or alternative without disturbing the master file. Then once we are sure about the changes, then we can merge the branch to the master file.
